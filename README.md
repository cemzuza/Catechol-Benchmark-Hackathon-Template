# Catechol-Benchmark-Hackathon-Template
This repository contains a solution for the Catechol Benchmark Hackathon, focused on predicting three reaction yields for catechol chemistry. The approach uses task-specific MLP models, physicochemical solvent descriptors, and organizer-defined cross-validation, achieving strong local RMSE and competitive Kaggle scores.
